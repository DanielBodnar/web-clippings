[How Liveblocks works](#how-liveblocks-works)
---------------------------------------------

The foundations of Liveblocks are built upon four core concepts: products, rooms, integrations, and platform.

### [Products](#products)

Liveblocks is a fully integrated solution built around core products, each enabling a different facet of collaborative experiences: [Presence](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/presence), [Broadcast](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/broadcast), [Document](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/document), and [Comments](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/comments) (private beta). You can decide what products you want to use based on your requirements and collaborative experiences you’re looking to build.

### [Rooms](#rooms)

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate. You can require your users to be [authenticated](https://liveblocks.io/docs/rooms/authentication) to interact with rooms, and each room can have specific [permissions](https://liveblocks.io/docs/rooms/permissions) and [metadata](https://liveblocks.io/docs/rooms/metadata) associated with them.

### [Integrations](#integrations)

Integrations for specific libraries and frameworks to add Liveblocks-powered collaborative experiences to your product. Integrations are designed to serve various collaboration use cases such as text editors, comments, creative tools, forms, and more.

### [Platform](#platform)

Liveblocks provides a fully-hosted platform built around a WebSocket edge infrastructure that effortlessly scales to millions of users. The platform equips you with a set of powerful tools such as our [REST API](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints), [webhooks](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/webhooks), [schema validation](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/schema-validation), analytics, and more.
